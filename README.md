Testing comment please ignore!!!

In this test project, my test program visits the facebook website and firstly try to log in without success. After that the program enters the username and password so that it can access the facebook. Then, the program visits www.n11.com website and from there through 'Kitap, Oyun, Müzik, Eğlence' dropdown box clicks 'kitaplat' (books) section of the website. From there, it clicks the 'yazarlar' link. Finally, the program checks whether there are maxium 80 authors name in the given author page (for the first and ,if available, second page only) and checks if the last element of the first page and the first element of the second page is the same or not. After checking all letters(A-Z) the program terminates and the test passes.
